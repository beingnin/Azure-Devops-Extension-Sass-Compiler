# Azure-Devops-Extension-Sass-Compiler

This extension can be used to compile sass files and also add vendor prefixes to css files. In other words, the extension has the ability to compile scss input into css output and later add vendor specific prefixes to the output css. So the devops engineer gets all the functionalities required to process any sass file in release and build pipelines. The Process-sass-files task is compatible with both Azure Devops Services and Azure Devops Server(on-premise).
